As a child, Malvika Sharan was given two options: science or humanities, but for Malvika, it was not a choice, as science always held a fond place in her heart. After completing her undergraduate studies, Malvika took a break and secured a job with a consulting firm, which helped her find a master's program in Germany. She spent 11 years in Germany, and at the end of her master's program, she felt as if she had not completed her education. Her love for learning led her to pursue a PhD in bioinformatics. She was exposed to open source science during her PhD and was focussed on the life sciences aspect. But as her career progressed, she became more interested in contributing to the social aspect of open source coding. This interest had roots in her lived experiences of access limitations and seeing the need to bridge them. Open source coding / Open Science had no borders with Malvika as her experience in contributing to various projects was met with globalization and community. Her contributions have included, but are not limited to, founding ‘Open Life Science’, an organization focused on furthering leadership in science and facilitating the development of open research skills. At her previous organization, she worked on a more generalized role not focussed on life sciences, where she worked on developing a community management program that was funded institutionally. The drive for community has led her to pursue her current role at St. Jude, which is focused on her passion for helping accelerate discovery with AI. In addition to enabling 3000 medical workers to facilitate better care with AI. She had the foresight to realize that the source of funding would be discontinued in the near future; therefore, along with her team, she worked on making it a sustainable endeavor and transitioned the project to a non-profit to make it evergreen. Her career trajectory has always been inclined towards the social good, even when it meant moving across borders several times, to make a larger impact towards aligned goals and ethics.
