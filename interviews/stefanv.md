## The Role of Community in Open-Source Software

### Introduction
Stefan van der Walt began his career in contributing to open-source projects while he was getting his Masters' in Electrical Engineering at Stellenbosch University. His advisor introduced him to the Python ecosystem. Through the open-source software community, Stefan became connected with Berkeley. He eventually completed a post-doc at UC Berkeley and is now a Senior Researcher at the Berkeley Institute of Data Science (BIDS). 

### Current Projects
Stefan works on the Scientific Python Project, which is meant to cover the needs of all scientists. He has contributed to libraries such as Skyportal and NetworkX. In particular, he has focused on image processing. He developed scikit-image, which is an image processing library.

### Motivations, Challenges, and Rewards
To Stefan, the most rewarding aspect of contributing to open-source software is the opportunity to work with a diverse range of people. Not only has he developed a strong technical skillset from his work in Scientific Python, but he has also developed interpersonal skills. While working with this community, he has been able to create an avenue for honest conversations. He says that it is these strong interpersonal relationships that yield higher-quality work.

In regards to open-source work, people think that “open-source comes with prestige and monetary rewards.” Instead, the work is rewarding because of how it benefits society and how he enables other people to succeed – for example, seeing software that he has contributed to being used in a Mars Rover. In addition, he is motivated by seeing colleagues have access to the best possible tools. In his view, open-source software makes science more transparent and accessible.

### Takeaways and Reflections
When asked about the future of open-source work, Stefan reflected on how AI is changing the current landscape. One of the challenges he noticed is how to keep creativity alive in the age of AI. When people use AI, they “forgo the opportunity to learn.” Instead, real learning comes from small steps and creating a strong foundation to build upon. He recommends starting small: fixing small bugs, contributing to documentation, and facilitating communication around the software.

Further, Stefan emphasizes the importance of community in open-source work. He describes, “the real joy comes from the connection with other humans, not just reading machine-generated code.” What connects this community is not purely the result; rather, it is the understanding that each member is contributing to “build something that is bigger than one individual”. Stefan emphasizes it is this philosophy in particular that resonates and enables “a bunch of volunteers” to “compete with a whole industry and get away with it.”
