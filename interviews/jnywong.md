**[BIDS Newsletter]**

Hello Data Science bears!
Have you ever wondered how Jupyter Notebooks work? Did you know that you can collaborate with people on it?
Cool people work for sciences and open sources and have you ever thought about joining them but never really understood the actual concept? 
DON’T Worry. BIDS got you! 

Open source is a model of software and hardware development where the source code is publicly shared, allowing anyone to use, study, change, and distribute it for any purpose. When things get complicated and when you are confused about a certain part of the code, it’s always a good idea to invite people to work on it with you. Double up the efficiency and get the work done.

[Key Takeaway]
Sometimes it is intimidating to get involved in a project or when you get stuck, you don’t know who to ask. The point of an open-source community is to help guide and support you so you can create the projects you envision. The great thing about having a community is knowing that transparency is an upfront topic. There are many unethical aspects within computing and data—like mutating results to match what you want  or change real data—the collaborative nature is a home to making sure we are as ethical and transparent in whatever we create. This means reproducibility is possible. Reproducibility is the process to obtain consistent results in an experiment or project so if there is an important experiment or project leading to life-changing results, we can recreate the process and do it ourselves. You can maintain integrity of your work while getting feedback and new ideas when working within an open-source community. 

[TLDR] 
Ethics and transparency behind working for open source projects: A lot of  scientists in the field put in extra voluntary hours to maintain the systems and make sure things are running smoothly without getting paid or recognized. 
As students, and as scientists trying to build something: it’s always good to do it collaboratively instead of struggling on your own, and the open sourcing/pull request facilitates that process.
There are built-in guidelines for collaborating your code in platforms like JupyterHub.

[Student Takeaway]
So I’m sure a lot of you have taken DATA C88C or CS61A and worked on the notorious BEE project. And actually, it’s encouraged to work on it as a group and that’s how the collaborative aspect kicks in. But, the process seems scary if you don’t know how to use the platform. What we learned is the possibilities are endless as long as you make the effort to start. With the open-source community, there are so many possibilities within interactive coding. For example, within JypterHub, there are 1,000s of projects with collaborator pages which are mini guides to show you how to start and get involved within the project. You can be 3,000 miles away from the original creator and still be able to work with them with just a click away. Because there are always pages within each project to show and share how more people can get involved, don’t be intimidated. Knowing this now, it is more than easy to work on group projects and review each others work. Working together should be encouraged to bounce around ideas and find a connection within your work; now it is more possible within open-source and interactive computing. 

[About Jenny Wong]

This week, we are spotlighting Jenny Wong! Jenny comes from the UK and has a background in Applied Mathematics. Her love for collaboration, interactive computing, and the open-source community has led her to working as an Application Engineer at 2I2C, home to your professor’s favorite platforms like JupyterHub ( which is her specific project). 2I2C is a platform that allows you to create and manage new projects with people all over the cloud. They help you develop your projects and give you the guidance and support to create your visions for life. We had the opportunity to interview Jenny to further understand her part in 2I2C.
 
[Spotlight Interview with Jenny]

Q1: Please tell us more about what you do.
Jenny: interactive computing - data science, tools eg. jupyter notebook, R,
provide infrastructure  for large groups of people. adv-> massive data local laptop isnt able to handle, JupyterHub

Q2: How did you get started in the fields of open source?
Jenny: The motivation was that wishing the thousands of problems there could be solved in interactive ways, making it more convenient.  So there’s no need to wait for the perfect piece of code.

Q3: What’s your day to day sense of feeling at this work?
Jenny: It feels great to build something and share reproductive work with people. Quite a lot of ppl are scared of cloud these days, especially with the problems that peole need to track resource uses, etc. 

Q4: How do you decide your priority when having to maintain thousands of repository problems and how do you decide whether you want to work alone or work on it with people. 
Jenny: Our priority is to help new people to get engaged in the problems they never dealt with before, so that as small as our team is, we can make it grow.
