                Learning about BIDS impact and Jarrod Millman's contributions to the Scientific Python Project

Have you met someone from the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) open-source science community? As BIDS interns, we had the great opportunity to meet with a significant figure, Jarrod Millman, to get an idea of the open-source research that BIDS fosters. 

Jarrod Millman is a Senior Open Source Scientific Python Developer at BIDS. He has co-founded several important initiatives and projects, including the Scientific Python project. 

For such a complex project filled with open and accessible tools, the Scientific Python project is made by the scientific community for the scientific community. Examples include studying High Particle Energy Physics, Geospatial data, Neuroscience, and even Astronomy. Millman explained the inspiration behind the project in that they wanted to make various tools available, but most importantly, open for all. The project not only focuses on accessibility, but also on providing enhanced collaboration and support for the scientific and computing community. 

There are a variety of unique tools that the Scientific Python project uses to accomplish its mission including web, development, organization, insight, and github applications. During the interview, the development and insight tools stood out to us! 
The development tools include python packages to provide universal usage across the ecosystem of different teams. Examples include testing such as pytest-doctestplus, and repo-review to ensure repositories are following guidelines. This enables a more unified streamlined process for developers to maintain their projects. Furthermore, the analytics tools include tracking metrics such as website visits and devstats tools. For example, the project statistics enable showing the number of merges over time for PRs or pull-requests such as for merged NumPy and merged SciPy. Jarrod also highlighted that there was an additional surge of merges between different teams and collaborates with their project tools and work after creating this initiative. 

When asked if he had any advice for anyone looking to contribute to a scientific open source project, Millman responded excitedly based on his long and rewarding experience with the Scientific Python project, elaborating that people should work on what they are passionate about and, of course, trust the process. “There were many times when something new came up and we would have to start from scratch,” he explained with a smile. But even though the journey might have been long and challenging, Millman explained that the most important thing is to focus on what’s important to you, be knowledgeable in the domain, and align your project idea with it. 

Although our time with Jarrod Millman was very limited, our conversation focused on his experience, and the Scientific Project was a rewarding experience in learning more about open source projects that leave a lasting impact on various communities.
