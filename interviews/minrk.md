Min Regan Kelly started his open-source journey ten years ago with a research lab in Norway working on biomedical systems. As he was working, he had difficulties with package installation processes, as they were time-consuming and burdensome. From these experiences, he was driven to make package installation as accessible and easy as possible. His main open-source project, conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org>, helps students from all disciplinary backgrounds install and run packages no matter in class or for their projects. His inspiration started when he worked at a summer school in computational physiology where he mentored and helped students with package installation. 

Dr. Regan-Kelly’s advice for anyone looking to contribute to an open-source project is to diagnose issues and understand what would be helpful. For students with a data-science background, this may mean reading through documentation and focusing on domain-expertise. The hidden work inside of maintaining the an open-source project is that there are constant updates. The process of debugging and reproducing takes a lot of time and it is also challenging, so don’t be afraid to reach out to contributors as well to collaborate! 

As a Berkeley alumni, he is always looking for ways to connect with students and the Berkeley community. Feel free to reach out <minrk@berkeley.edu>
