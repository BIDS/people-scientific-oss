From teaching and industry to building tools used by millions, Jason Grout's journey through open source reflects BIDS's commitment to making tools accessible for everyone. Now working on Jupyter Notebook, Jason bridges the worlds of academia, industry, and open source community to help every learner to gradually adapt to coding through interactive, accessible tools.

Q1: JOURNEY 
Khue and Daniel: “How did you get into open source/your current project and motivation for it?”
Jason: “It was my background studying Math and Computer Science that sparked my interest in programming. My first touch with open source was through SageMath, working with their database of mathematical objects. From there, I pivoted to Jupyter Notebook. While at Sage, we used Jupyter in our day-to-day operations frequently. One day I noticed a small bug in the system. Because Jupyter is open source and accepts suggestions from everybody, I was able to make a one-line CSS modification that improved their system. As time went on, I gave more feedback on their changes and updates,I made it a goal to give at least one piece of feedback for each Jupyter release. Eventually, I guess I contributed so much that they wanted me to do what I was doing, but full-time. It was really rewarding going from a small contributor to a core developer on the project now.”

Jason: “Overall, the biggest motivation for me is to make improvements for users and by building tools that are accessible and useful to the community.”


Q2: CURRENT WORK 
Khue and Daniel: “What are you working on right now and what you enjoy most about it?”
Jason: “I work on Jupyter Notebook from multiple angles, from the software development itself, but also the community and sustainability aspects like fundraising. Open source is about more than just code. I'm involved in planning meetups, making decisions about the project's brand and website, and building connections between people. The community aspect is what makes this work meaningful and the best part about my job."

Q3: IMPACT 
Khue and Daniel: “What problem does Jupyter solve, and how has the community evolved as the project has grown?”
Jason: “Jupyter addresses a fundamental challenge: how do you help people who aren't programmers start coding? Jupyter lets people gradually adapt by showing immediate output. You change one number and instantly see the result. This immediate feedback opens up computational tools to people who might otherwise be intimidated by programming.

Our community has grown dramatically. When we started, the community was so small that each person knew who wrote what line of code. Today, Jupyter has way more active contributors, and the project has expanded so much that it required us to develop deep trust among contributors and create organizational structures. We've organized sub-projects like JupyterHub, Notebook, and Lab, each with their own teams and focus areas. This scale comes with many collective decisions about direction, priorities, and maintaining our values as we grow.”

Q4: ADVICE 
Khue and Daniel: “What advice would you give to someone who wants to start contributing to open source?”

Jason: “Start small. If you're already a user of a tool like Jupyter and you find any part of it annoying, even something tiny, you actually can fix it by being a contributor. We have a graph that shows a few people with lots of contributions, along with many people having only a few contributions. That's the encouraging part! It demonstrates that open source is truly user-friendly: everyone can contribute to the products they use, even if it's just fixing one small annoyance. You don't have to become a core maintainer or commit to years of contributions. You can be one of those people who fixes the one thing that bothers them and moves on. That single contribution still makes Jupyter better for millions of users. So if you're using a tool and thinking, "This one thing is annoying," don't just accept it, fix it! That's how you start contributing to open source.” And you know what’s the best part, you can be that person today!”
